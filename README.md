# Pyramid-Block
Pyramid using python

Let’s recreate that pyramid using Python, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself is also be taller than it is wide.

Pyramid block is in such a  that it prompts the user for the pyramid’s height, storing their input in a variable,
re-prompting the user again and again as needed if their input is not a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. 
Then, simply print the value of that variable, thereby confirming (for yourself) that you’ve indeed stored the user’s input successfully.
